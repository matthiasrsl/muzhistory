# Muzhistory

This web app retrieves your listening history from the Deezer API and displays it neatly. You can browse your entire listening history! You can also see the artists, albums and tracks you listened to the most during the past week, month or year.

**The website is available: [Muzhistory](https://muzhistory.eu.pythonanywhere.com)**
